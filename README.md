# Sensor-fault-detection


### Problem Statement

This project focuses on binary classification for identifying failures in the Air Pressure System (APS) of heavy-duty vehicles, which use compressed air instead of hydraulic systems to provide pressure to the brake pads. The affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by a certain component of the APS.


### Solution Proposed

The proposed solution aims to address the issue of minimizing unnecessary repair costs in the Air Pressure system (APS) of heavy-duty trucks. The project will use a binary classification approach to classify the failures as either being related to a specific APS component or some other component. The focus will be on reducing false predictions and minimizing costs.
