# sensor-fault-detection
This project focuses on binary classification for identifying failures in the Air Pressure System (APS) of heavy-duty vehicles, which use compressed air instead of hydraulic systems to provide pressure to the brake pads. The affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by a certain component of the APS.
